My Tester's portfolio
## About me 
My name is Marzena JÄ™drzejowska. I am a master of science in environmental engineering. I have been interested in software testing for some time and have recently decided to retrain. My goal is to develop knowledge and technical skills in testing. On this page, I would like to share all my experiences. Currently, I have completed an individual course for a manual tester. Shortly, I would like to take the ISTQB exam and master SQL at the primary level.
